# Advanced-Captstone
Notebooks, Images and Datasets for IBM Advanced Data Science Capstone Project

This was the final project for the Coursera IBM Advance Data Science certification.

I used OpenCV and a custom trained alphanumeric character recogniser to automate the process of scanning documentation. I have used some of the code from this project to develop my NLP toolkit as used in Project Alexandria.
